# Pull Request Commands

`pr-command` is an action that enables you to run commands on your pull requests using comments.

This action will be triggered on comments on pull requests: it checks-out your pull request, runs a command, and commits the result back to the branch.

When the command is started, a 🚀 is added as a reaction on the comment, and when the command is finished and changes are committed, a 🎉 is added as a reaction. If the command fails, 😕 is added as a reaction.

This can be used for anything, but examples include:
- `!pr lint` lints the code.
- `!pr update-screenshots` updates screenshots for visual regression tests.
- `!pr coverage` generates coverage reports
- `!pr dedup` deduplicates yarn packages in `yarn.lock`.
